## Mobile-Captured Image Document Recognition for Vietnamese Receipts 2021 (MC-OCR 2021)

This repository contains our source code of both Task 1 and Task 2 in the RIVF2021 MC-OCR Competition.

### Introduction

Mobile  captured  receipts  OCR  (MC-OCR)  is  a  process  of recognizing  text  from  structured  and  semi-structured receipts, and invoices in general captured by mobile devices. This process plays a critical role in the streamlining of document-intensive processes and office automation in many financial, accounting and taxation areas. However, MC-ORC faces big challenges due to the complexity  of  mobile  captured  images.  First,  receipts  might be crumpled or the content might be blurred. Second, different from scanned images the quality of  photos  taken  with  mobile  devices  is  very  diverse  because of the light condition and the dynamic environment (e.g., in-door, out-door, complex background, etc.), where the receipts were captured. These result in low quality of recognized information.  To  address  them,  in  this  challenge,  we  target two  tasks  including  (1)  evaluating  the  quality  of the captured receipt, and (2) recognizing required fields of the receipt. The task hence is a multi-modal analysis task which can take advantages from both fields: computer vision and natural language processing which are two of the main interests of the RIVF community.
